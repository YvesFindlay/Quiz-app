This project was my first on my road to becoming a front-end developer. It's a Quiz App with different menus with a progress loader. This application makes use of css keyframe animations with css grid and also includes a model to aid in menu navigation.

## Functionality

This app has quiz categories: Sports, Landmarks, Wildlife, Films, History and Nature. With 3 levels: Easy, Medium & Hard.

Easy - 10 questions to be completed in 10 minutes.
Medium - 20 questions to be completed in 15 minutes.
Hard - 30 questions to be completed in 12 minutes.

Some categories are harder than others :)

## Tools

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
